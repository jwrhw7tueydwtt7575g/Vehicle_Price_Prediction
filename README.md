# 🚗 Vehicle Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict vehicle prices based on various features such as year, fuel type, kilometers driven, and more. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file containing details about used vehicles, including:
- Brand
- Model
- Year
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Owner Type
- Kilometers Driven
- Price (Target variable)

> **Path:** `dataset.csv`
